## Project Overview

This internship project aims to explore and develop machine learning models for three different tasks:

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**: Predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on passenger data.
2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.
3. **Iris Flower Classification**: Classifying Iris flowers into species based on their features.

The goal is to learn and apply various machine learning algorithms and techniques to solve these real-world problems.
